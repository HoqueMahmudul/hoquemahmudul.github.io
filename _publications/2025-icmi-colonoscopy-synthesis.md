## Abstract

This work introduces a novel approach to generate synthetic medical images from textual prompts using fine-tuned DreamBooth and LoRa. The study focuses on image synthesis and image classification, evaluating the quality and diversity of generated images using Inception Scores and Fr√©chet Inception Distance. The results show consistent average Inception Scores of 2.36 across datasets, with FID scores (0.11 for single-center, 0.073 for multicenter, and 0.076 for combined) indicating that the generated images closely resemble real ones. In the combined data set, EfficientNet shows superior performance, achieving 89% training accuracy and 91 % validation accuracy, significantly outperforming other models. In particular, all models exhibit slightly higher validation accuracies compared to their training accuracies, Indicating a good generalization. The substantial performance gap between EfficientNet and the other models, with a difference of at least 19 percentage points, underscores its exceptional effectiveness on this dataset. This research highlights the promise of AI-generated medical images, while emphasizing the need for ethical considerations and strategies to use them in healthcare applications.
